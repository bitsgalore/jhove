<h1>Using third-party modules with JHOVE </h1>

<p>
Adding third-party modules to JHOVE is a simple matter if they
follow certain requirements. This page describes those
requirements, and provides links to modules that have been
written outside HUL.
<p>
A third-party module should be packaged as a jar file containing
only the code for the module (not the classes of JHOVE itself).
Multiple modules, if related, may be put in the same jar.
The jar should include source code as well as classes.
The license terms should be indicated in the source files
or an accompanying text file.
Additional jars may be required and should be documented.
The jar(s) then need only be added to the classpath to be used
with it.
<p>
To avoid confusion with HUL-created code, please do not put
third-party modules in a package which begins with
<code>edu.harvard.hul.ois</code>.
<p>
Individuals
or institutions wishing to donate locally-developed modules for
redistribution to the JHOVE user community should submit a statement of
their intention to <code>jhove-support at harvard.edu</code>.
<p>
See also <a href="/documentation/dev-module/">Writing a Module</a>.

<h3>Third-party modules available for download</h3>
<p>
Please note that these modules are <b>unsupported</b> by HUL,
and that you use them at your own risk.
